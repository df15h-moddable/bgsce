# Mojave Area 51 Rascal Zetans

Adds RascalArt's Zetans to select locations in the Mojave for some Area 51 vibes.

ESPFE doesn't consume a slot in your 255 plugin limit.

INTENT

- Add some flavor to the Mojave. The "Area 51" theme feels right.
- Fill in some empty spots in the Mojave.
- NOT to overrun the Mojave or clobber existing content.

CAVEATS

Version 0.1 is a functional proof-of-concept. It includes only one location.
Version 0.2 refines and adds distributions. Be aware it re-compacts Form IDs. See sticky post.

TODO

Refine distribution (locations and leveled character spawns).

CREDIT

This mod is functionally nothing more than a patch for the two mods upon which it depends. ALL CREDIT for original concepts and assets belong to those authors. Permission to leverage "Zetans" from RascalArt via private message. Per the GrilledTurkey team, "We have both retired from modding so any messages sent to this account will probably not be seen.... If you would like to make edits to our mods or make patches that is totally fine...."
