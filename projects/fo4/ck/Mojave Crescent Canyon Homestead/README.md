# Mojave Crescent Canyon Homestead

BUILD the NEW CALIFORNIA REPUBLIC.

The Mojave is kinda empty, so what's it really good for? Building! This mod adds an EXPANSIVE new location to a very empty end of the map. It has a Workshop and a huge buildable Settlement area. (If you're not familiar with the map, or if you just FORGOT this end of it, the new Homestead is not in a canyon -- it sits above the mod's own Crescent Canyon.)

Again, to be clear, the point of this mod is to provide another space just like Ivanpah. I don't plan to add features here that are not present at Ivanpah. And Ivanpah is an empty Settlement area with a shack in the middle, and that's it.

What this mod provides, from a gameplay perspective, is ...

- A reason to visit the Canyon end of the map more than once.
- A second major develop-able area in the Mojave similar to the existing Ivanpah Basin (but even a bit larger -- see the screenshots). One could build a sprawling city at Ivanpah, but I think of it more as a space for 3-4 widely spaced settlements. This Crescent Canyon area mod provides room for 5-6. All together, 10 settlements are enough for a New Republic, right?

How to Use

- ESPFE doesn't consume a slot in your 255 plugin limit.
- The map marker is pre-discovered. You can see it as soon as you enter the Mojave.
- Ownership is triggered when you approach the Workbench.
- The buildable area (as of v0.3) covers almost all the empty space between points of interest. From the broken rail bridge over the South Canyon. to the entrance to the West Canyon, to the Airplane Crash Site and Pit Stop Ruins in the north, to the Nipton Drive-In in the east.
- The house has no interior. The navmesh allows followers and NPCs onto the front step, but not into the covered porch or the back patio. The covered porch is intended to be built as a compact starter bed and storage shelter for the player while the settlement grows.

Why?

- Because Project Mojave is essentially unfinished, it's surprising it isn't more heavily modded.
- Because the Commonwealth is a dense, dangerous place (and because I don't use Fast Travel), the way I play is this: I turn the Commonwealth settlements over to Sim Settlements 2 City Plans, AND THEN do all my hands-on building in emptier worldspace expansions like Project Mojave. In the case of the Mojave, I custom build Nipton Park and Nipton Rest Stop, then do a hybrid SS2 build at Ivanpah.

CAVEATS

I started with a light touch, which means ... I did not go nuts savaging pre-existing markers, spawn points, weather patterns, etc. So presently there are things like a Giant Scorpion spawn point within the bounds (but stuff like that has always been true in the original mod too, e.g. at Nipton Rest Stop).

KNOWN ISSUES

Learned that Settlement Menu activation is tied to Workbench proximity rather than exclusively to build area. Therefore you'll find the menu won't activate in some of the further parts of the build area. You need to move back towards the bench, activate the menu, then move back to the outer edges to build. I use Kinggath's Workshop Plus, so this is quick. But it may be a hassle for some. To be clear, this is a foible of the game architecture. The build area is separate and safe.
There are a few floating trees and rocks in this area in the original mod (Project Mojave). Not caused by this mod. Maybe I'll fix those.
