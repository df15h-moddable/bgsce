# New Vegas Grass Patch

If you use True Grass or a similar grass mod, you may find that some outdoor areas of Project Mojave's New Vegas are overgrown. This mod repaints a few grass-able textures with non-grass-able textures.

- On the Strip, this mod overpaints some grass-able textures with vanilla Asphalt.
- In the Gamorrah Courtyard, this mod overpaints some grass-able textures with vanilla Coastal Dry Sand.
- In the Tops Pool area, this mod overpaints some grass-able textures with vanilla Coastal Dry Sand.

Looking in the CK at the textures being overpainted, these choices seem close to the original intent.
