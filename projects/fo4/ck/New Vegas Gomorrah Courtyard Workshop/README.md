# New Vegas Gomorrah Courtyard Workshop

Makes the Gomorrah Courtyard into a buildable area (in Project Mojave's New Vegas).

Expect this to behave like an interior (non-recruitable) Workshop.

Workshop ownership is triggered when you enter the Courtyard. Nothing to clear.

CAVEATS

- Notice the version is not yet 1.0.
- It includes the very minimum to make the area buildable.
- It includes compacted Form IDs in order to be flagged as ESL (ESPFE). Any next version of this mod might be re-compacted.
- This is a location in which I do not expect all the usual Settlement features to apply. A fully operational Settlement is not the intent.
- The original Worldspaces that make up The Strip are unique and more challenging to understand than e.g. the Mojave. See "Bugs".
- Nothing is scrappable yet, because the courtyard is full of custom objects that aren't in scrap lists yet. You can add new items to the courtyard but not move or remove preexisting items.
