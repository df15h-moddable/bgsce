# JK's Tricksy Trees x Ulvenwald Happy Little Driftwood Patch

If you use JK's Skyrim (Rorikstead) or JK's Whiterun Outskirts and Ulvenwald or Ulvenwald Lite, you may notice some floating shrubs. JK has used a trick since JK's Skyrim of standing up driftwood and using shrubs to simulate leaves. Ulvenwald intentionally replaces driftwood with an invisible mesh.

This patch uses open assets from Happy Little Trees to override the invisible mesh. Just load after Ulvenwald.

This patch is intended to illustrate the issue. It is NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION.

Any solution which overrides or restores vanilla "tundradriftwood01.nif " will solve the problem. This patch is here as a convenience and/or illustration.
