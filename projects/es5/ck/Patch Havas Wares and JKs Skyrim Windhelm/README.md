# Patch Hava's Wares and JK's Skyrim Windhelm

If you use "Narrative Loot" and "JKs Skyrim" you'll find that the exterior door to Hava's Fine Wares (added by Narrative Loot) is stuck sideways into a wall. It's functional, but ugly and un-immersive. This is a CK-made patch to square that doorway up neatly. Nothing else.

Edits three objects from Narrative Loot: the position of the door, the position of the door trim, and disables an extra superfluous overlapping door trim. The door functions as normal.
