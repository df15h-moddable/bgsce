# Heljarchen Farm Grass Patch

A simple patch to paint land textures in order to suppress "overgrown" grass for Skvindt's Heljarchen Farm when used with grass mods like Folkvangr. Replaces some tundra areas with dirt path. Then adds a little tundra grass in off-the-path places to make up for the new barren areas.

This patch only addresses Heljarchen Farm when used without adjacent mods, BUT here are some notes regarding my experiences ...

- Urtho's Settlements Expanded (upgrades the Loreius area). I used this mod (all patched up) with Heljarchen Farm for years. I never encountered landscape issues. I expect my patch works fine with it.
- Ryn's Loreius Farm (standalone). I found this one the most problematic. Without community grass patches for Ryn's mod, I found only a small gap between Ryn's Farm and Heljarchen Farm. With community grass patches, I found a tear nearly the size of the whole manor house. Predates my patch.
- Ryn's Farms AIO. This is how I am using it now. I haven't found any gaps yet and my patch seems to be harmless with this combination. I have not reinstalled other community grass patches for Ryn's Farms yet due to my negative experience with the patches for the standalone (vis-a-vis Heljarchen Farm, which they obviously do not take into account).
