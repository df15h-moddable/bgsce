# Windstad Mine Grass Patch

A simple patch to paint land textures in order to suppress "overgrown" grass for Skvindt's Windstad Mine when used with grass mods like Folkvangr. Replaces some grass-able areas with non-grass-able. In particular, the area around / under the smelter's "cage" and adjacent boardwalks.
