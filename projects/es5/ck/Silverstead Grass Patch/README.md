# Silverstead Grass Patch

If you use a grass mod such as Folkvangr, you may notice that Silverstead is overgrown in places. This mod re-arranges the distribution of Reach Grass and Dirt Path textures to better match the layout of (built) Silverstead.

Opinion: Blackthorn still gets mod love to this day. Silverstead deserves as much. The two mods by the same author are very much of a kind, and equally as good.

Hint No.1: Silverstead is pretty solid these days, even in large load orders. I didn't use it for a while due to a landscape problem -- but it turns out I had shot my own foot. Silverstead's modifications to the mountain-top upon which it sits DO NOT AGREE with pre-fab "undersides" such as the one provided with EVLAS. So, one either needs to use Silverstead w/o any of these underside solutions, or one needs to generate their own as part of the DynDOLOD process. The latter is what I do, and Silverstead works great.

Hint No.2: Silverstead doesn't conflict with much, even Markarth Outskirts. But ... if you use "Heart of the Reach" you must sort Silverstead to "load after" that one. (It places its dungeon entrance very close.) And LOOT doesn't have this rule in its data set yet. You must add that rule manually.
