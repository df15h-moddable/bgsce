# 3DNPC Rift Watchtower Disabler

A disabler for 3DNPC placements at the Rift Watchtower.

It presently disables the two unique NPCs and the three revelers -- and all the associated clutter I could find via SSEEdit.

Feedback appreciated. At this point I just want to see if disabling the NPCs works properly. Why wouldn't it work? Because if you look at Takahashi's own disablers, they seem to be script-based. But I rather did old fashion record flagging. So ... note that I've tested adding this mod both before ever reaching the cell, and in a save where the cell had already been loaded once. The former case seems reliable -- it's the latter case I wonder about.

This was made with the "Orc Exiles" mod in mind.

IF there is already another solution available, I would love to hear about it and I would abandon this one.

A few more notes ...

The original mod touches two clearly named cells. The clutter in the named cells seems mostly to be bottles and food. Most of the statics that are/were there are vanilla.
There is apparently a 3DNPC quest that sends us to a barrel on the second level of the tower. It seems that this barrel only appears during a certain quest stage. I have NOT disabled this barrel. I may need to move it a smidge to make sure it doesn't clip into the walls of Orc Exiles. If you are using this without Orc Exiles, everything will be normal.
Levels 1 and 2 of the main tower in Orc Exiles -- while very changed -- are similar enough to vanilla to accommodate the same object placements. Therefore I am not too worried about the barrel even though I have not play-tested it.
Dravos is apparently tied into a quest in which he is summoned to another location. I'm hoping my disabling of his placement (the placement only) at this location doesn't harm that quest stage (at a different location). After all, he still exists as a named NPC.
To my present knowledge there are no other quest progression tie-ins. The unique NPCs here were mostly just for color.
