# Extensions

Mods that fix or extend Papyrus.

Prerequisite:
Note that mods that extend Papyrus usually depend not only on SKSE,
but also on mods (like Address Library) that extend SKSE.

- ExiledViper's [PapyrusUtil](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13048). New scripts for convenience functions such as data storage, etc.
- NightfallStorm's [Papyrus Tweaks NG](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/77779). A collection of fixes, tweaks and performance improvements. By convention, mods named "NG" are "next generation" iterations by new authors on abandoned mods deemed essential by the community.
- PowerOfThree's [Papyrus Extender](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/22854) @ nexusmods.
