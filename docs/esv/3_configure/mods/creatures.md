## Skyrim Immersive Creatures

Do not use. Why ...?

- Contains a lot of nonsense and even some lore-unfriendly nonsense.
- Advertises MCM toggles for "almost everything" but actually not nearly everything.
- For example, defaults to enable swarms of wolf puppies, which literally every commenter agrees is a terrible idea.
- For example, includes enemy Huskies, which literally every commenter agrees is a terrible idea.
- Once we start toggling off nonsense, we find we're not left with much.
- In fact, once we start toggling off nonsense, we find we're _only_ left with 4thUnknown's stuff.
- So ... we get better control by _just_ using 4thUnknown's stuff directly.

## 4th Unknown

- Everything is sterling. Use it all.
- However, a number are ESP NFE, which we may want to merge before using.

## Mihail

- Quality is spotty with respect to animations and AI.
- Quality is spotty with respect to (rather ugly) World Edits.
- Obviously, use only those where quality is good.
- The best ones make no World Edits and re-use vanilla animations.
