In file `RSV_DISTR.ini` ...

With respect to this line ...

```
Spell = RSVHeadTexturePatch|*RSV,-RSVignore
```

... and this line ...

```
Skin = 0x818~Racial Skin Variance - SPID.esp|*RSV,-RSVafflicted,-RSVasian,-RSVdremora,-RSVelder,-RSVfantasymer,-RSVsnow,-RSVvampire,-RSVvampirebeast,-RSVwerebear,-RSVignore
```

Add these ...

```
,-Avriel,-Jorunn,-Nikkitta,-Zala
```

Why? Because ...

- VNDKTR Avriel, Nikkitta, Zala: The RSV skins seem to be additive to and darken or discolor VNDKTR's Diamond Skins. I prefer the RSV skins, since Diamond Skin looks plastic. But it seems I'd have to figure out how to patch these to make them work.
- Wammy Jorunn: First, one of the selling points of Wammy's Jorunn is that the face tinting is already very interesting, and for once RSV is actually a downgrade. Second, RSV causes her to lose her hair.
