(Even though we no longer use "Landscape Fixes For Grass Mods",
this doc is worth keeping because the ramaing mods still present a challenge.)

## Problems

- Landscape under the horse for Convenient Carriages. Horse floats.

## Silian Manor

With respect to a landscape tear near the Basement trapdoor in the front garden ...

- Order `SilianManor.esp` after `Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods.esp`. LOOT will do this naturally when both are flagged ESM.
- Order `SilianManor.esp` after `Solitude Exterior Addon.esp`. LOOT doesn't help here.
