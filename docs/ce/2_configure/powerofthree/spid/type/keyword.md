Keywords

Keywords can either be distributed as normal, using formids from other mods,

Keyword = ActorTypeRich|SomeRichGuyEditorID

Keywords will be applied first, so you could distribute a keyword to NPCs, and then check if it exists when distributing other things

Keyword = ActorTypeSentry|*Sentry

Spell = 0x123~BetterSentries.esp|ActorTypeSentry
