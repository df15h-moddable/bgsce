Papyrus works by ...

- ... receiving Events from the game.
- ... sending function calls to to the game.

"It's also important to remember that papyrus scripts only run in response to the game and other scripts. Therefor all of your code needs to live inside an Event block, or inside a Script Fragments such as a quest stage fragment, or topic info fragment."
