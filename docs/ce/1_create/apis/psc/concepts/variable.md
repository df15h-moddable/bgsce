# Papyrus Variable

"A script can also have Variables. A variable is a value that can be modified and reference by the game and scripts. For example, you might want to store the number you get from a GetActorValue(). With variables you can store this information, and use it later."

"Variables_and_Properties can be defined to be simple structures like a Boolean, an Integer, a Float, etc. But their real power lies in that they can be defined as and hold any Object Type. A Quest script, for instance, can have a property that holds a pointer to an Actor. Once you have a pointer to an object in a script property, that script can run functions on that property and thus on the object in it. For example, a quest script holding a property pointing to an Actor, can call Kill() on that property and it will kill that actor. Properties can be set by the script at run time, or can be set by pointing to objects in the editor."
