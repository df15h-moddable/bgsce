# Papyrus Property

"A script can also have Properties, which function almost identically to variables, except that other scripts can ask about and set them. Properties can also be modified in the editor. (Note: In reality properties are a bit more complex than simply a “variable that you can get/set externally,” but for practical purposes, that's a fine way to think of them)."
