## Problem

"Interior workshops like Diamond City Player Home, Vault 88, and Chapter 2's HQ impact the NPC pathing of every other interior cell in the game.
Things you build in an interior workshop will block pathing in all other cells if the coordinates of things happen to intersect areas NPCs are meant to walk.
For example, if you build a bed in one cell at coordinate 0/0/0, all other interior cells with a navmesh near 0/0/0 will have a bed shaped hole cut in them." [3]
