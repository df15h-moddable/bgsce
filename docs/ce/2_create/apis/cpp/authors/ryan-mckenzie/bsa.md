"C++ library for working with the Bethesda archive file format."

"The Bethesda archive file is a proprietary format used to store game files for the The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series of games beginning with the The Elder Scrolls III. This format is essentially a zip file which stores some extra meta information to be used with their internal virtual filesystem. There are many tools that can be used to work with these files, but most are written as user facing applications, without the intention to be used as a library. bsa intends to provide a low-ish level interface for C++ programmers to work with the format."
