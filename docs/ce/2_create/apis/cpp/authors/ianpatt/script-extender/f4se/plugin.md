# How to Create a F4SE plugin

None of this is well-documented, but it is better documented for ESV than it is for FO4.
See our corresponding ESV page.

The source code for F4SE is included in every distribution.
It can also be found on [Ian Patterson](https://github.com/ianpatt)'s GitHub account.
Note that we will need to obtain and load this source into our IDE if/when we plan to write a plugin.
