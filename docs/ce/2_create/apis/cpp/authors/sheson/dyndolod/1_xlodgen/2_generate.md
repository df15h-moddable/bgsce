1. Notice that it generated `meshes/terrain` and `textures/terrain` in our previously empty "GENERATED OUTPUT XLODGEN" mod directory.
2. Notice, if we inspect the mod (right-click > "Information"), that in the "Conflicts" tab we are now overriding many existing meshes. (Presumably these represent a reconciliation, as with a bashed patch).
3. Disable "xLODGen Resource - SSE Terrain Tamriel" (although the author says it's harmless if we forget).
