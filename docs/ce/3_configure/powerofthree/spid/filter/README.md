# Filter

Filters identify target NPC(s).

Filters take the format ...

```
|strings|formIDs(OR)editorIDs|min/max level|gender/unique|NONE|
```

Unused filters can be marked as `NONE` or left blank.

Combining multiple filters will progressively restrict the pool of targets.

Distribute the same record multiple times to add it to different types of NPCs.
