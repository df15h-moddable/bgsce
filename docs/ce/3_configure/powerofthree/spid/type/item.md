# Items

All items (that can be added to NPC inventory) are accepted.

However, changes between Skyrim and Fallout 4 means that NPC inventory is now baked into saves, and will require ResetInventory or a new game.

Leveled Items are included under Item.

itemCount is the amount of items that should be added. Default is 1 if no count is specified
