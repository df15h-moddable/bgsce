OUT-OF-DATE (PROBABLY).

Creation Kit should be added automatically to MO2's executables menu. If not, add it manually. [1]

## Application Load Error

Problem: When we launch the CK from MO2, get get a dialog `Application Load Error V:0000065432`.

Solution: In MO2's executable configuration for the CK, find "Overwrite Steam AppID" and enter `1946180`.

This solution (and that ID) seem to be internet consensus, and it works.
