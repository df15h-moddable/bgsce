Problem ...

1. [Silent Horizons 2 - Universal Core](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/99398) doesn't include Depth-of-Field.
2. [McFly's Depth of Field for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23363) is the standard solution for this problem.
3. But McFly's doesn't behave out-of-the-box. It requires additional fiddly configuration.
4. And McFly's isn't to my taste anyhow.

Solution ...

1. [Rudy ENB for NAT 3](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/91675) includes a DoF file that works out-of-the-box.
2. And we can install it same as [McFly's Depth of Field for ENB](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/23363). Which is to say ...
3. From the `enbseries` directory in Rudy, copy `enbdepthoffield.fx.ini` and `enbdepthoffield.fx`.
4. Paste them into the corresponding location in SH2.
5. Launch the game and open the ENBSeries panel (Shift + Enter).
6. Open the "Depth of Field" menu (bottom of right pane, probably).
7. In the "Technique" menu, select our new solution.
8. Apply, Save, Exit.
