## Compatibility

As a rule ...

- Small load orders can more safely tinker with extravagant all-in-one overhauls.
- Large load orders require a greater level of compatibility planning.
- The safest path is an "enhanced vanilla" approach.
- Any other path is a _guarantee_ we will be playing whack-a-mole _forever_.

Therefore, when building a large load order ...

- Do not use landscape mods that alter darned near _every_ exterior cell (e.g. "Lux Orbis", "Lux Via", "Northern Roads").
- Do not use flora overhauls that alter landscape meshes (e.g. "Folkvangr").
- Do not use "Landscape Fixes for Grass Mods" (because it alters landscape meshes).
- Do not use flora overhauls that place grass outside vanilla bounds.
- Use a vanilla flora enhancer (e.g. "Veydosebrom Regions").
- Do not use tree overhauls that place new trees.
- Use a vanilla tree enhancer (e.g. "Happy Little Trees").
- Do not use settlement replacers (e.g. "Cities of the North").
- Use vanilla settlement enhancers (e.g. "JK's Skyrim").
