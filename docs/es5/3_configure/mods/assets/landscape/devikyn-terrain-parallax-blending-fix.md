"Terrain parallax normally disables the usual blending that the game does between two different textures. This plugin fixes that problem"

"You may have noticed when using any landscape textures with parallax that the blending on corners of certain objects (like cliffs and some roads) is completely removed, leaving a nasty seam that looks totally unrealistic. This simple ESL-flagged plugin creates a best-of-both-worlds scenario where as many of these seams are fixed while preserving your favorite parallax textures, and without requiring any messy mesh edits! A small amount of work is needed to set this up for your game."
