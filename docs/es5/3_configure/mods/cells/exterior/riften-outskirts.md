this doc is worth keeping because the ramaing mods still present a challenge.)

With respect to Elianora's Ruska home partially buried by landscape ...

- Do _not_ use the standalone Ruska patch from AgentW's "Riften Docks Overhaul". In this particular mix it will break Ruska entirely.
- But we must use the Ruska + Ryns Farms patch from AgentW's "Riften Docks Overhaul". The "Riften Outskirts" patch depends on it.
- "Riften Outskirts" includes official patches for a handful of mods we use all in close proximity: Convenient Carriages, Khajit Has Wares, Ryns Farms, Ruska.
- Ordering the patches matters. We haven't figured out a conclusive order yet, but we know the Ruska patches must be moved late.

### SOLVED

This seems to work ...
