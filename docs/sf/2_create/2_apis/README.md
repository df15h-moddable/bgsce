# APIs

Creation Engine games have two significant APIs ...

- Papyrus (PSC) : Bethesda's proprietary scripting language. Extended by the community (SKSE and others).
- C++ (CPP) : The language with which the Engine was built. Reverse engineered by the community. Modding facilities provided by SKSE.

About console (Playstation, Xbox) APIs ...

- Only the vanilla Papyrus API is avaiable.
- SKSE and C++ are not available.
- Most Papyrus extensions are NOT available, because those depend on SKSE to bind Papyrus to C++ 
(just as SKSE does).
