# Fallout 76

- Fallout 76 is built on a fork of Fallout 4's engine.
- In theory, it's just as moddable as Fallout 4, but ...
- ... that's not very practical, given the online nature of the game.
- However ... it means that data miners can use standard tools (like xEdit) to inspect Public Test Server builds.
- For example, see [Nuka Knights](https://nukaknights.com/en/).
