Q: Is all my material related to these games here?

A: No. Only stuff I would find publicly useful myself, in a logically organized format. Material not matching that intent is in `df15h-ce-private`.

Q: Are there any modlists or load orders here?

A: No. My configurations are committed to `df15h-ce-private`. But the "Community" sections here list mod authors I find most interesting and reliable (which often corresponds with popular).

Q: What, no Elder Scrolls III Morrowind, Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion, Fallout 3, or Fallout New Vagas?

A: On a technicality, those aren't Creation Engine games. They were created with Gamebryo, before Bethesda forked it. But more decisively, I prefer a third-person camera, and apparently old Gamebryo wasn't good (was terrible) at that.
